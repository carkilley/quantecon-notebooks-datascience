The warm storm that moved through the interior over the weekend deposited about 40-60 cms of snow. The new snow has been pretty heavy at all but the highest alpine elevations. The freezing level has risen to about 1800 metres, and the wind has been very strong out of the southwest. I would not be surprised to find out that natural avalanche activity has occurred on Sunday.

The depth of the new storm snow above the various old surfaces is what is driving the danger ratings at this time. Large surface hoar and near surface facets are widespread above various crusts and hard wind slabs. Some areas have a sun crust in the alpine on steep south and west aspects. There is a rain crust that is buried between 40-55 cm in some areas that reaches up to about 2200 metres. The mid-pack is reported as generally strong and well settled. Observers are still able to find the early November surface hoar layer. This layer has not been reactive during the recent long dry spell. Tests show that it is getting harder to pull the snowpack apart at this interface. We may still see this layer become active again if we get the right combination of load and warm temperatures. Going down deeper, we still need to consider the interface between the snow that did not melt over the summer, the glacial ice, and the October rain event.

Strong winds 60 km/hr with gusts to 80 km/hr are forecast from the southwest on Friday night and Saturday.  Some models are showing high freezing levels for Saturday, possibly up to 2000 metres.
