Any remaining uncertainty with regard to their strength is generally limited to high north aspects and the possibility for triggering with a heavy load, such as a cornice collapse.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Deeper persistent weak layers from earlier in the season are generally considered dormant, but some deep layers, such as sugary facets at the base of the snowpack, are more prominent in the Cariboos than in other areas of the interior.
