This area holds cold air and tends to be a known area for a weak snowpack. Below treeline, the story is the same as always- get out of there ASAP! Treeline is where we start to see a significant change in the snowpack depth and quality. The majority of areas at treeline have a consistently thick layer of facets above the crust. The older windslabs that were everywhere earlier in the month have rotted out and become less of a problem. The exception is in areas that had seen severe windloading. Any area that had a hard slab prior ro the cold snap, tends to still have the slab intact. That hard slab appears to have acted like a barrier and increased the amount of facetting below. We encountered some VERY hollow sections today. Here's the word: variable! Every ski turn brought a different character. The alpine is similar, but expect the Nov 12 crust to fade away at about 2400m.

As the team walked on the top of a ridge, they triggered a small cornice chunk(10m away) that went on to release the storm slab below. The slab itself was up to 40cm thick and entrained a large amount of snow as it traveled. East aspect, 2400m, a short steep slope with a large fetch.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">2) A party of 3 scramblers triggered a Sz 2 slab in alpine terrain and went for a ride.

Any new snow that fell has been blown into storm slabs. Even the older facetted snow has been blown around to create fresh windslabs. Areas near the divide (Burstall Pass) saw up to 20cm of new snow in the last 24-48 hours. When that fresh snow is combined with wind, slabs up to 60cm thick are common. Open areas at treeline and alpine have a widespread windslab problem and alpine areas have an additional storm slab problem in immediate lees(easterly aspects). It feels as though we are on the verge of a small natural cycle. These slabs appear to be running on the older windslabs, but quickly involving the midpack facets.

This thick layer is actually made up a series of laminated slabs from various wind events. These slabs are sitting on a delicate layer of facets that were buried on Deb 18th.

Today, that slab has settled and become less reactive. The other chapter to the story is the rapid loading from the new snow. The snowpack was forced to adjust quickly which created another avalanche cycle at treeline and above. The deeper trouble layers are not taking to this adjustment well. The natural cycle is tapering, but the snowpack is still extremely touchy.

The principle concern at all elevations and aspects is still the deep, basal weak layers.
