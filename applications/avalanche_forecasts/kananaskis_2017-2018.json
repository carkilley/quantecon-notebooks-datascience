Some areas are a softer slab, while others are quite hard (kicking to get a ski edge in) and often hollow sounding.

We'll have our hands full when that changes...The Oct 31crust is breaking down and variable in its character. Some places it is intact and others it has broken down/compressed and become part of the &quot;base&quot; snowpack. In both instances, it is still considered a weak layer and failing in tests after moderate loads. In the alpine it is very similar, but the depths are proportionally deeper.

BUT, if/when there is a slab above it, expect this layer to be a very serious avalanche problem. Meanwhile, the Dec 15th is starting to fail in stability tests (CTM12, SC down 70cm). The difficulty with both of these layers is knowing where they are NOT in the terrain. In some areas we've seen the surface hoar up to 2300m and in in others only up to 2200...and to make it worse yet, in some areas we have seen bands of surface hoar that show up at random intervals.

A profile at the top of Tryst Chutes had the Dec 15th down 115cm, Jan 6th down105cm &amp; the Jan 18th down 90cm. The test results were mixed. We had one test fail with sudden results from a moderate load (CTM12 SP). This was notable and concerning as if failed on the dec 15th layer. The other test had slightly better results, but still concerning. In this test, it failed with a heavier load (ECTP22 on the Jan 6th).
