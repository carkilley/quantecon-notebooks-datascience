Firstly, the wind once again picked up and created new slabs in the alpine. Judging from how things look, these slabs are isolated in nature and mostly in immediate lee areas. Treeline was spared the full brunt of the wind so there is a bit of new snow overlying the older windslabs. Having said that, there may be slabs in wind exposed areas. Secondly, there is a hint of sun crust on solar aspects. In Alpine and treeline areas the mid pack is generally well settled with a minor shear (failure) noted on the Jan 17 layer. I say minor because the snow above isn't a slab yet and the layer is shallow. The deeper weak layers are just...deep &amp; weak. From what we can gather, in deeper snowpack areas the bridging effect of the midpack keeps the house of cards from collapsing. In shallow areas, all bets are off.

As of this afternoon ridgetop winds were around 50km/hr from the SW. Windslabs are building on any easterly aspect in the alpine and treeline areas. How well these slabs stick to the underlying windslabs is the question. Given how long the slabs were exposed for, it may be a poor bond at first.

To sum up the observations, its fair to say the snowpack is changing and the relatively solid snowpack is taking a turn for the worse. The winds picked up last night and instead of changing to a westerly flow, they held a northerly direction and lingered for the better part of today. This made for a rapid reverse loading pattern in the alpine. Lots of spindrift made reactive windslabs around cliffs. Treeline didn't escape the wind either. Slabs are there, but not as thick or dense as higher up. In an untracked, rocky, thin treeline area we had shooting cracks of up to 20m and large settlements. Remoting avalanches suddenly seemed like a real possibility. Open, below treeline areas also had large settlements on the Jan 17 surface hoar. The solar input is strong enough to soften the snow. The warming trend and wind loading is to blame for this rapid decrease in stability. </span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\"> For most of the night temps will be around -13. In the early morning expect them to drop a few more degrees. Settling at -18 by 8am. UP to 4cm is expected from flurries. Winds...if it wasn't for wind, we'd no weather discussion at all. They should be from the SW tonight, but at midnight they're expected to pull a 180° shift and blow from the NE. If that weren't enough, by noon tomorrow they'll shift to the south.
