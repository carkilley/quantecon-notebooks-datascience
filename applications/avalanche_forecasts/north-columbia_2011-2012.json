Don't get fooled by a lull in the action--the snowpack is in a very dynamic state right now so natural activity will likely ebb and flow but human triggering will remain likely even when naturals taper off.", "snowpackSummary": " On average, I'm guessing nearly 100cm of new snow has been added to the alpine snowpack in the last few days. Figure half that at treeline. Below treeline it's probably a mixed bag of rain, slush, and snow depending where you are in the region and elevation. Here's my take, based purely on experience, what little information I have from a few select locations, and recent weather. Snowpack depths are looking like 100-150cm at treeline and probably 250+cm in the alpine. Distribution is likely still pretty variable due to winds and variability in storm track and intensity. On a small scale you'll likely see bare ground beside areas with well over 250+cm of snow while on a larger scale, one mountain or drainage may have significantly more or less than the next. The upper part of the snowpack consists entirely of new storm snow in sheltered areas and new wind slabs in exposed locations, both of which are likely settling rapidly with warm temperatures. I'm pretty certain the storm and wind loaded snow is unstable both at the new/old interface and within the new snow at various levels. How unstable and how long the instability lasts in lulls between systems and after this whole thing ends will relate primarily to temperatures. Click on the forecaster blog link below for a bit more detail on this. These problems are changing by the minute and hour so you need to stay on your toes. Settlement will be occurring in the midpack as well but crusts and the November 7 surface hoar, which could be down as deep as 200cm in some locations, continue to be a concern. If these layers have not been destroyed by previous avalanche activity, my gut tells me they are on the edge of the knifeblade and are capable of producing very large slides. I expect settlement is going on in the deeper layers as well. Still a mixed bag there though, with weaker facetted snow in shallow areas, stronger more rounded in deeper locations, and in many cases these layers will be moist at and near the ground. This is a general overview--I'm hesitant to get too specific this early in the season when data is sparse and there's so much spatial (and now with the ongoing storm, temporal) variability.

Figure half that at treeline. Below treeline it's probably a mixed bag of rain, slush, and snow depending where you are in the region and elevation. Here's my take, based purely on experience, what little information I have from a few select locations, and recent weather. Snowpack depths are looking like 100-150cm at treeline and probably 250+cm in the alpine. Distribution is likely still pretty variable due to winds and variability in storm track and intensity. On a small scale you'll likely see bare ground beside areas with well over 250+cm of snow while on a larger scale, one mountain or drainage may have significantly more or less than the next. The upper part of the snowpack consists entirely of new storm snow in sheltered areas and new wind slabs in exposed locations, both of which are likely settling rapidly with warm temperatures. I'm pretty certain the storm and wind loaded snow is unstable both at the new/old interface and within the new snow at various levels. How unstable and how long the instability lasts in lulls between systems and after this whole thing ends will relate primarily to temperatures. Click on the forecaster blog link below for a bit more detail on this. These problems are changing by the minute and hour so you need to stay on your toes. Settlement will be occurring in the midpack as well but crusts and the November 7 surface hoar, which could be down as deep as 200cm in some locations, continue to be a concern. If these layers have not been destroyed by previous avalanche activity, my gut tells me they are on the edge of the knifeblade and are capable of producing very large slides. I expect settlement is going on in the deeper layers as well. Still a mixed bag there though, with weaker facetted snow in shallow areas, stronger more rounded in deeper locations, and in many cases these layers will be moist at and near the ground. This is a general overview--I'm hesitant to get too specific this early in the season when data is sparse and there's so much spatial (and now with the ongoing storm, temporal) variability.

I know that there is generally 200 cms of snow in the alpine. Some areas are bound to have closer to 250 cms. There was a period in early November when the conditions were optimal for the development of surface hoar. By the middle of the month when the first heavy snowfalls arrived, we were getting reports of widespread avalanche activity releasing on buried surface hoar from the few areas that were accessible. The snow has continued to build up in the mountains and the winds have been from strong to very strong from various directions. I suspect that the depth of snow in the alpine and at treeline is quite variable due to these winds re-distributing the snow that was available for transport. Last Thursday we had a report from the south Selkirks that there had been a widespread natural cycle of very large avalanches that appeared to have released very near to the ground. This type of activity would usually be because of some kind of early season crust that is thick enough and hard enough that it has not broken down in the 5-6 weeks since it has been buried. I suspect a rain crust because the avalanche activity was observed from several aspects, mostly north and east. If it is a rain crust, maybe it is limited to the South Selkirks? The warm storm that moved through the interior over the weekend deposited about 40-60 cms of snow. The new snow has been pretty heavy at all but the highest alpine elevations. The freezing level has risen to about 1800 metres, and the wind has been very strong out of the southwest. I would not be surprised to find out that natural avalanche activity has occurred on Sunday. Maybe the added load will cause some more avalanches to release down at the rain crust? If not, the new load and warm temperatures might help to settle the snowpack and promote bonding. If it gets cold, the deep weakness may continue to be a problem for a while.  I suggest giving the snowpack a few days to reveal its secrets. I will feel less uncertain once we have more operators reporting from the field.", "weatherForecast": " The trailing cold front should have moved through the Interior ranges by late Sunday. On Monday a weak ridge of high pressure should bring drier conditions, maybe even some sunshine. It would be nice to get out and see what the last storm brought to the mountains.

Last Thursday we had a report from the south Selkirks that there had been a widespread natural cycle of very large avalanches that appeared to have released very near to the ground. This type of activity would usually be because of some kind of early season crust that is thick enough and hard enough that it has not broken down in the 5-6 weeks since it has been buried. I suspect a rain crust because the avalanche activity was observed from several aspects, mostly north and east. If it is a rain crust, maybe it is limited to the South Selkirks? The warm storm that moved through the interior over the weekend deposited about 40-60 cms of snow. The new snow has been pretty heavy at all but the highest alpine elevations. The freezing level has risen to about 1800 metres, and the wind has been very strong out of the southwest. I would not be surprised to find out that natural avalanche activity has occurred on Sunday. Maybe the added load will cause some more avalanches to release down at the rain crust? If not, the new load and warm temperatures might help to settle the snowpack and promote bonding.
