There were numerous reports of natural and human triggered avalanches in storm snow (up to size 2.5) and on persistent weak layers (up to size 3.5). Avalanches have been reported on all aspects. Most releases have been reported from elevations above 1800 m although some skier-triggered avalanches have been reported from lower elevations. There were similar reports from Tuesday and this follows a continued trend of recent heightened avalanche activity.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">I anticipate the amount of natural avalanche activity to decline into Friday and Saturday, but human-triggered avalanches will remain likely.</span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">The current snowpack is complex, with three active weak layers that we are monitoring.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">60-90 cm of storm snow sits on a layer of crust and/or surface hoar from mid-January.

These avalanches ran on all aspects above 1800m. In the Selkirks, 2 slab avalanches (up to size 2) were remotely triggered on the Mid-February layer.

The avalanche, which is thought to have been triggered by sloughing from above, occurred in the Monashees near Revelstoke on a northeast facing slope at 1900m. This avalanche points to the continued reactivity of deeper persistent slabs in isolated terrain. Continued light snowfall snow and strong winds will promote ongoing wind slab activity, especially in exposed higher elevation terrain.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\"> </span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\"> </span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Since Saturday night, 20-50 cm of new snow fell.

I suspect strong winds will have redistributed much of the new snow into fresh wind slabs in exposed terrain. 40-70 cm below the surface lies another interface with similar character and distribution. This layer, which was buried in mid-February, has just started to produce large avalanches and is definitely worth keeping an eye on as the overlying slab gains thickness and cohesion.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">There are several persistent weak layers that are showing signs of improving but still remain suspect as low probability - high consequence avalanche problems. Two surface hoar layers buried in January are now 100-150 cm below the snow surface. Deeper in the snowpack (150 - 200 cm deep) is a facet/crust/surface hoar layer buried in December. Near the base of the snowpack is a crust/facet combo layer buried in late November.
