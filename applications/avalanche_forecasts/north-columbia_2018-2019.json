On these colder slopes, you may find 10-30 cm of dry powder or isolated wind slabs. These same slopes may also have a layer of faceted grains buried 50 to 70 cm below the surface. This layer has been responsible for a few large isolated avalanches last week. Elsewhere, the surface has been melting each day and then freezing into a hard crust overnight. Snow is disappearing rapidly at lower elevations.</span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">MONDAY NIGHT: Clear, light north wind, alpine temperatures drop to -5 C.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">TUESDAY: Sunny, light wind, freezing level up to 1800 m.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">WEDNESDAY: Increasing cloud with flurries starting late in the afternoon, light southwest wind, freezing level up to 1800 m.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">THURSDAY: Scattered flurries bring 5-15 cm of new snow at higher elevations, 20-40 km/h southwest wind, freezing level up to 2000 m.</span></p>", "dangerMode": "Regular season"}]
