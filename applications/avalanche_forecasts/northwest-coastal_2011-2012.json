Exposure to the sun, warm temperatures, and periods of rain are the most likely factors to influence the avalanche danger. If the temperatures go below freezing overnight, strong crusts should develop that are likely to hold the snowpack together. If the sun shines for a few hours, the crusts may break down quickly and moist surface snow avalanches may start running naturally. Continued warming from more sun, rain, or no overnight freeze, may cause surface avalanches to step down and trigger deeper wet slab avalanches. Prolonged warming may cause very deep releases on weak layers that were deposited early in the season, or on depth hoar that developed during the winter. It is important to monitor the temperature and the freezing levels as they may change rapidly from day to day.", "snowpackSummary": "As we transition into spring, the surface layers have a great deal of influence on the snowpack. When there is a solid re-frozen surface crust, travel is fast and easy, and the snowpack is held together by the surface cap. Any deeper persistent weak layers are unlikely to fail until the surface cap breaks down from daytime heating. When there is no crust, surface layers and any deeper weak layers may fail, depending on the amount of heat and the triggering force that is applied. If it cools off and snows, new snow and wind slabs may not bond well to the hard spring crusts.
