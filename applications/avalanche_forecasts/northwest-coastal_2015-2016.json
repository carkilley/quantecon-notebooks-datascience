Due to limited observations, I have very little confidence in what that underlying structure may be, although faceting, crusts and surface hoar development have been reported from various parts of the region. The region is now seeing moderate outflow winds from the N-NE which may be redistributing some of the new snow onto opposite slopes.

Reports from Monday include more evidence of natural avalanche activity that occurred during or post storm late last week with observations of recent widespread persistent slab avalanches up to Size 3.5. On Saturday, there was a report of a remotely-triggered size 2.5 avalanche that likely failed on the January 9th surface hoar. This slide occurred on South aspect at around 1200 m. Explosives control work in Ningunsaw Pass also produced numerous slab avalanches to size 3. Most of these slides were from N-E aspects in the alpine and at treeline. Many initiated on the mid-January surface hoar but then stepped down to deeper persistent weaknesses. This type of avalanche activity highlights the current challenge of dealing with buried persistent weak layers that are becoming harder to trigger, but if triggered they will produce very large and potentially deadly avalanches.</span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<style type=\"text/css\">\n.p_CC664AAA { margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;text-align: left;text-indent: 0pt;padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; } \n.s_AA239A9B { font-family: 'Arial';font-style: Normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 13px;color: #000000; } \n</style><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">Moderate winds on Wednesday may have started to build new wind slabs.

Over the past few days the wind has been minimal in most places but pockets of fresh wind slab could be found in lee and cross-loaded features in the alpine and at treeline. Sheltered alpine areas could be harboring a weak layer of surface hoar buried late last week, which was recently found down 60cm.

About 60cm below the surface you'll likely find a crust that was buried on February 28th. A report from northwest of Rosswood suggests a recently buried layer of surface hoar may also exist in the upper snowpack, although I'm unsure of its size or distribution. An older crust buried in early February can now be found around 80-120cm below the surface. This crust, which may coexist with small facets or decomposing surface hoar, was recently producing sudden planar results in tests.
