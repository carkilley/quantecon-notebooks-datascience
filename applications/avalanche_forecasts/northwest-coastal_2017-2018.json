Under these conditions, rain saturated and eroded the snowpack at lower elevations while new snow accumulations of up to 60 cm blanketed the alpine. New snow depths are heavily elevation-dependant, with new snow depths below treeline ranging from 0 to 20 cm. Below the new snow, two weak layers are noted to have formed during the early season. (October 31 and November 11) Although their widespread presence is fairly certain, very few observations or tests of their reactivity exist. With that said, ongoing loading of the upper snowpack carries the potential to activate these deeper weak layers. Looking further to the north of the region near Ningunsaw, the snowpack is starkly different. Here, much drier, colder early season conditions produced a shallow snowpack composed mainly of weak, sugary snow.
