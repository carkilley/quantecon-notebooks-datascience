If the upper layers feel dense and show a tendency to crack or pull apart as a cohesive element, conditions may be primed for a slab avalanche. Watch the bowls below ridges, gullies, and lee slopes where snow tends to accumulate deep enough to slide. Second, new snow from this year often bonds poorly to pockets of last year’s snow that survived the summer. These pockets are often found near the top of bowls, on the shaded side of steep gullies, under cliffs, on glaciers, and in high elevation, leeward terrain.

Recently temperatures have been warmer in the alpine than in the valley, which may have made the alpine snow slightly firmer (in sheltered locations - it's already firm where it's been drifted by wind). Snow depth at treeline varies from about 1 m in most areas to 2 m in deeper snowpack areas in the south and west of the region. The shallow snowpack areas mostly consist of weak facetted or sugary grains beneath hard slabs. These hard slabs may produce surprisingly long fractures resulting in large avalanches, and in some instances they may step down to weak faceted snow crystals near or at the ground. In addition to the facets, a thick layer of buried surface hoar may be found 30-40 cm below the surface. There is another persistent weakness that formed during the early December cold snap which is now about 50-70 cm deep. </span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_1681A555\">Friday: Flurries.
