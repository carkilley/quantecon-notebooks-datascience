We had a report today from a professional member that flew through the Selkirks south of Revelstoke on Thursday.  Widespread natural activity was observed up to size 3.5 in the alpine that was running full path into the valleys. Some fracture lines appeared to be about 2 metres deep and very wide. In some areas very large avalanches had run out onto low angle terrain.  Most avalanches had initiated between 2200m and 2600m. Avalanches were observed from all aspects, with north and east being the most frequent. I think that there is a great deal of variability out there, and we should all be very conservative this weekend.", "snowpackSummary": " Generally we have about 150 cms in the alpine, and treeline has been showing some variability between 50 -150 cms. There are locations in the alpine that have 200 cms plus already. The freezing level went up to about 1900 metres on Wednesday and caused some pretty rapid settlement, followed by below freezing temperatures that have re-frozen the snow pack up to about treeline elevations. The wind has come from the southwest during the last storm, and then strong from the northeast immediately following the storm. Yesterday the wind was strong in the alpine from the east-southeast. We were feeling pretty sure that there was a major avalanche cycle going on in the alpine, that we thought was probably failing on the buried surface hoar layer that has been reported to be down about a metre. Today we received new information from the Selkirks south of Revelstoke that there was indeed a major avalanche cycle up to size 3.5 during the last storm, but it appears that most of the avalanches were sliding on a layer that is near the ground; perhaps a rain crust from October. The slides may have started on the surface hoar layer and then stepped down to the crust. We hope to get some more information soon, as operators start getting out into the field. There is probably a lull in activity today (Friday), but I am hesitant to bring down danger ratings with the limited information that we have. The next storm is forecast for Saturday, and it looks like it is going to come in warm again, maybe up to 2000 metres. I think the \"take home\" advice from recent activity is that you should be very suspicious of any slopes in the alpine that have not recently avalanched.  If there is a crust of some type down low near the ground, you should be watching out for areas that might re-load with the next storm. Due to the variability of the amounts of snow in different drainages, I think that the absence of recent avalanche activity in an area would concern me as well. These are difficult early season conditions to evaluate. I recommend being very conservative this weekend. It is going to take a few days at least before we see any improvement.

This layer has not been reactive during the recent long dry spell. Tests show that it is getting harder to pull the snowpack apart at this interface. We may still see this layer become active again if we get the right combination of load and warm temperatures. Going down deeper, we still need to consider the interface between the snow that did not melt over the summer, the glacial ice, and the October rain event.

The Purcell has been getting less snow in the recent storms than the Selkirks. The fast moving waves of precipitation brought about 20 cm to some areas in 4 or 5 hours overnight into Sunday morning. There was a period of above freezing temperatures at treeline on the Rockies side of Kicking Horse Pass that may have also affected the treeline areas of the northern Purcell. The depth of the new storm snow above the various old surfaces is what is driving the danger ratings at this time. Large surface hoar and near surface facets are widespread above various crusts and hard wind slabs. Some areas have a sun crust in the alpine on steep south and west aspects. There is a rain crust that is buried between 40-55 cm in some areas that reaches up to about 2200 metres. The mid-pack is reported as generally strong and well settled. Observers are still able to find the early November surface hoar layer. This layer has not been reactive during the recent long dry spell. Tests show that it is getting harder to pull the snowpack apart at this interface. We may still see this layer become active again if we get the right combination of load and warm temperatures. Going down deeper, we still need to consider the interface between the snow that did not melt over the summer, the glacial ice, and the October rain event. If this deeply buried beast wakes up, we may see very large avalanches in high alpine north and northeast aspects. In weaker shallower areas, there is a layer of weak facetted crystals at the ground that has not been active since the early December dry spell. This layer may also \"wake up\" with additional load from new snow and wind.", "weatherForecast": " The ridge of high pressure that moved into the interior on Sunday is expected to continue to persist on Monday bringing clear skies and freezing levels near valley bottom.  The next system moving in from the Northwest coast looks very similar to the one we just experienced. It looks like precipitation will start in the Cariboo and North Monashee by early Tuesday. The freezing level is expected to rise to about 1000 metres by early Tuesday, and then to start to fall back to the surface by late afternoon. This is a fast moving system with forecast alpine elevation winds from the Northwest in the 50-70 km/hr range. A trailing cold front will continue to bring precipitation into Wednesday morning.

One remotely triggered avalanche triggered from 300m away caught my eye - it speaks to the propagation potential of the surface hoar now deeply buried. If this layer is triggered the avalanche will be big; this layer can be triggered from below so be mindful of overhead hazard. This layer will not go away in the next few days. Also, a sledder triggered a size 3 avalanche in the Quartz Creek area and while the machine is reportedly totaled, the rider is okay. There are two great observations from professionals working in the region recently.  The first one can be found on the MCR, it talks about the widespread & sensitive nature of the SH in the Northern Purcells.  You can start here and work your way into the March observations: http://www.acmg.ca/mcr/archives.asp The other is in the form of a youtube video which also deals with the surface hoar, highlighting the potential for remote triggering and large propagations when this layer fails.

Freezing levels topped out around 1400m Saturday, with the top 10 cm moistening as a result.  This new snow covers old pencil hard wind slabs which were created by last week's strong W/SW winds.  These wind slabs are getting more stubborn, and it likely takes a big trigger, like a falling piece of cornice to get them going.  That being said, they may still be sensitive to human triggering in areas where the snowpack goes from thick to thin, rock outcroppings being the classic example of this kind of structure.  The big story remains the early February Surface Hoar that is 90 - 160cm deep.  The snow above this weak layer has been under the influence of warmth and time which has settled the snow into a thick cohesive slab 90 -160 cm in depth.  Obviously, when a slab almost as tall as the average Canadian releases, the consequences are severe.  Operators in the region have been diligently gathering data on this weak layer; In snowpack tests, the layer fails in a sudden planar fashion indicating that it has lots of energy in it, and showing that when it does fail, it has the potential to propagate across large distances.  These tests mesh with the large avalanches that have been observed in the region recently.  Conditions have been favorable for cornice growth recently, as a result many ridge lines are sporting large cornices.

It sounds like the new snow was susceptible to skier & sledder triggering on steep convex features, producing avalanches to size 1.  The following observations are from Thursday/Friday:  In the dogtooth backcountry, observers reported a size 2.5 avalanche with a crown 1m+ in depth, that was likely human triggered.  Explosive control work once again produced large avalanches to size 3.5 on all aspects with crowns ranging from 40 - 120 in depth.", "snowpackSummary": "Another 6 cm of snow fell Saturday night bringing the weekend storm snow total up to 16cm of moist snow.  Much of the snowfall has been accompanied by light to moderate SW winds.  Freezing levels topped out around 1800m Saturday, with the top 10 cm moistening as a result.  This new snow covers old pencil hard wind slabs which were created by last week's strong W/SW winds.  These wind slabs are getting more stubborn, and it likely takes a big trigger, like a falling piece of cornice to get them going.  That being said, they may still be sensitive to human triggering in areas where the snowpack goes from thick to thin, rock outcroppings being the classic example of this kind of structure.  The big story remains the early February Surface Hoar that is 90 - 160cm deep.  The snow above this weak layer has been under the influence of warmth and time which has settled the snow into a thick cohesive slab 90 -160 cm in depth.  Obviously, when a slab almost as tall as the average Canadian releases, the consequences are severe.  Operators in the region have been diligently gathering data on this weak layer; In snowpack tests, the layer fails in a sudden planar fashion indicating that it has lots of energy in it, and showing that when it does fail, it has the potential to propagate across large distances.  These tests mesh with the large avalanches that have been observed in the region recently.  Conditions have been favorable for cornice growth recently, as a result many ridge lines are sporting large cornices.  Basal facets have only been reactive on steep, shallow, and rocky slopes, but operators continue to monitor this layer in tests. Triggering this deep persistent weak layer is unlikely, but shallow snowpack areas or shallow weak areas adjacent to deeper wind loaded slopes are the most suspect locations.", "weatherForecast": " A trough of low pressure anchored over SW BC allows for moist SW flow for the forecast period.

It was wide, deep and covered sled tracks. Photos here: http://bit.ly/GMOYCv . There were four other close calls in the Purcell Mountains last week, all involving very large slabs releasing either from a distance or with a light load. On Thursday, a snowmobiler remotely triggered a size 3.5 slab on an east aspect at 2400m at Oldman Creek, east of Quartz Creek (video here http://bit.ly/GLHIbg). It failed 1-2 m deep, was 200-300 m wide and ran full path, taking out mature timber.

In wind exposed locations this new snow has been formed into wind slabs which could be up to a meter in depth in the north of the region.  In the south these slabs are closer to 20 cm in  depth.  Below this lies a well settled snowpack.  Spring the season has arrived, operators reported moist snow as high as 2500m on Wednesday.  These warm temps have really helped to settle out the upper snowpack.  Professionals throughout the region are reporting a very well settled & firm snowpack below the recent storm snow.  The exception is slopes below 1000 meters, which have not refrozen for many days.  These slopes received as much as 10mm of rain Wednesday night making them rain soaked and sloppy.The sun is forecast to make an appearance Saturday morning & Sunday afternoon.  The spring sun is increasing in strength as each day grows by a few minutes.  It takes very little time for S, SE & SW aspects to feel the heat of the sun now.

At this point I think the probability of human triggering the deep slab is very low.  I don't really want to be proved wrong though, as the result would be large and destructive avalanche 1.5 - 2 m in depth.  The most likely location for this type of failure is where the snowpack goes from thick to thin.  This is most likely near ridge crests, the edges of slopes and especially around rock outcroppings.", "weatherForecast": " The provincial weather pattern is dominated by an intense pacific front that impacts the coast Monday afternoon, continuing through Monday night.

Under these conditions, surface avalanches may step down and trigger deeper wet slab avalanches. Prolonged warming may also weaken large and destructive cornices. Large cornice releases are dangerous, and may act as a heavy trigger on the slope below. Typically, avalanche activity increases during the day and is at a peak during the afternoon. If it's raining or there was no overnight freeze, avalanche activity can happen at any time.", "snowpackSummary": "As we transition into spring, the surface layers have a great deal of influence on the snowpack. When there is a solid re-frozen surface crust, travel is fast and easy, and the snowpack is held together by the surface cap. Surface layers and any deeper persistent weak layers are unlikely to fail until the surface cap breaks down from daytime heating. During warm conditions, melt water is able to percolate within the snowpack and cause surface layers and any deeper weak layers to fail. If it cools off and snows, new snow may not bond well to the hard spring crusts, and isolated storm and wind slabs can easily develop.", "weatherForecast": "", "dangerRatings": [{"date": "2012-04-25T07:00:00.000Z", "dangerRating": {"alp": "N/A:No Rating", "tln": "N/A:No Rating", "btl": "N/A:No Rating"}}, {"date": "2012-04-26T07:00:00.000Z", "dangerRating": {"alp": "N/A:No Rating", "tln": "N/A:No Rating", "btl": "N/A:No Rating"}}, {"date": "2012-04-27T07:00:00.000Z", "dangerRating": {"alp": "N/A:No Rating", "tln": "N/A:No Rating", "btl": "N/A:No Rating"}}], "problems": [{"type": "Loose Wet", "likelihood": "Possible", "travelAndTerrainAdvice": null, "comment": "Loose wet avalanches are most likely on steep slopes as temperatures rise or when there is no overnight freeze.
