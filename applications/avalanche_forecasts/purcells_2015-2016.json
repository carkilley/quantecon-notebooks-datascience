Northerly winds associated with last weeks outbreak of Arctic air stripped many south facing features near ridgecrest. As a result, tired old wind slabs have been reported on north facing features at and above treeline. The cold air and associated inversion created trophy surface hoar that seems to average around 20mm in size and can be found from creek bottom up to around 1800m. Sun and above freezing alpine temperatures were also part of the last week, so you're likely to find a suncrust on solar aspects (south and west) at and above treeline. The three different November surface hoar interfaces that we were previously concerned about seem to be a thing of the past and are not producing any activity.

Tuesday night's storm brought 1 to 5 cm that is likely being formed into small storm slabs. Previous to this, northerly winds associated with last weeks outbreak of Arctic air stripped many south facing features down to rock near ridge crest. As a result, wind slabs that have now grown old and tired were reported on north facing features at and above treeline. The cold air and associated inversion created surface facets and the well reported trophy sized surface hoar that averages 20mm in size and can be found from creek bottom up to around 1800m. Sun and above freezing alpine temperatures were also part of the last week of wonky November weather, so you'll find a suncrust at and above treeline just under the new storm snow on solar aspects. The three different November surface hoar interfaces that we were previously concerned about seem to be a thing of the past.

If the snow surface does not freeze overnight or if the crust is only a few cm thick, the effect of daytime heating, rain or solar radiation will weaken the snowpack much more quickly than it would if there is a well frozen thick crust. This is because the crust must first melt before the sun or rain can weaken the snowpack. Deeply buried weak layers in the mid snowpack and near the ground still have the potential to wake up and become active with a rapid warm up. While unlikely, releases on these deeply buried weak layers would result in very large avalanches. Glide cracks are widespread, active, and best avoided. Cornices are large, fragile, and could trigger deep slab avalanches that run to valley bottoms. The snowpack in many areas has become isothermal, meaning the snowpack is 0 degrees Celsius throughout.
