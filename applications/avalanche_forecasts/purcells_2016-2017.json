Crown depths ranged from 20-40cm. These occurred at high elevations and are attributed to wind slabs that have grown with recent wind and snow loading. An ACMG Mountain Conditions Report from Christmas day describes a slab avalanche failing on a steep, north facing slope at 2100m. This avalanche remains relevant for having stepped down 110cm to the November crust. The size of the avalanche is unknown, but this speaks to the touchy nature of persistent slabs in the area. On Christmas eve, a skier was partially buried in a size 2 slab avalanche while skinning up a northeast facing slope at about 2000m. The failure plane of this avalanche is unknown although the depth (40cm) suggests the mid-December weak layer may have been the culprit.

Moderate southwest winds have been redistributing the loose surface snow into new wind slabs in exposed higher elevation terrain. A highly variable 20-80 cm of snow overlies the mid-December interface which consists of stiff wind affected snow, faceted (sugary) crystals, and surface hoar that formed in sheltered areas. The overlying slab appears to have a poor bond to these surfaces in some areas, especially in wind-affected terrain in the Dogtooth range and possibly Quartz Creek. In sheltered terrain, the overlying slab has remained soft. As it continues to settle and gain cohesion, we may start to see a more widespread persistent slab problem develop. </span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">The thick mid-November crust/ facet layer typically sits 70-140 cm down in the snowpack.
