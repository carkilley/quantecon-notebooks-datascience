This layer is composed of a crust on all aspects at low elevations. At upper elevations the layer presents as a crust on solar aspects (those that face south and west) and buried surface hoar on polar aspects (those that face north and east). The reactivity of this interface has been steadily decreasing, but it continues to produce large avalanches and the potential for deep 'step down' avalanches cannot be dismissed.

Test profiles show resistent planar failures at this interface. In wind sheltered terrain Saturday's new snow rests on a surface crust that exists on all aspects aside from true north below 2000 m.

The likelihood of triggering a deeper persistent slab avalanche is steadily decreasing but the consequence of doing so remains high.
