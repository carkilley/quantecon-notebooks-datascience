Recent extreme northerly winds have &quot;reverse loaded&quot; much of the new snow onto southerly slopes that were previously scoured. Moderate northerly winds continued to promote this wind slab formation into Wednesday. The existence of wind slabs on solar aspects is important to note as clear skies will allow for strong solar radiation to affect these aspects.

Strong northwesterly winds on Sunday morning have redistributed this and other loose snow at the surface, likely forming a few thin new wind slabs in lee terrain. Below any new snow accumulations, recent cool temperatures formed up to 5 mm surface hoar on the previous snow surface. The same low temperatures have been responsible for faceting at the snow surface and in the upper snowpack. Sun crusts exist beneath the skiff of new snow on steep solar aspects below about 1700 metres, with a more widespread temperature crust found below about 1500 metres. Below the new snow interface, roughly 20-40 cm of recent (faceting) storm snow appears to be bonding well the widespread mid-February melt-freeze crust. This crust extends as high as 2200 m and is up to 15 cm thick at treeline. Below this crust the mid and lower snowpack are well settled and bonded.</span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_384D933F\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Monday: Cloudy with sunny periods.

This slab is currently bonding poorly to the old surface which includes scoured crust, hard sastrugi, stubborn wind slabs and up to 20cm of facets in sheltered areas. Just below this interface is the mid-February crust which remains active. This crust is 50 to 80cm below the surface on average, it should be easy to find and test in your profiles.

I think this kind of shallow wind slab in alpine terrain is representative of the ongoing wind slab concern: localized pockets, lee and cross-loaded features, around 20 to 40 cm thick. Saturday's fatal avalanche accident on Mt. Harvey, although not in the Sea To Sky region, does highlight several of the risks posed by cornices: multi-ton snow boulders serve as large triggers potentially releasing large avalanches on the slopes below, they can break well back making for tricky travel along ridge crests. It's all the more tricky when visibility is obscured in fog or heavy snow, if the easiest pathway (flat, hard snow, open straight line) is within the danger zone, or when they're so big that you need to be 10 or 15 or more metres back from the edge to remain safe.</span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">Recent snow in the last few days built wind slabs, primarily on northerly aspects at alpine and treeline elevations. They should stabilize quickly with warm temperatures but isolated wind slabs behind ridges and similar terrain may linger. Expect multiple crusts in the upper snowpack, especially on southerly facing (sunny) slopes. Thin crusts with facets above are possible; southerly aspects are complex and hard to forecast. Personally, I'd try to avoid them until corn season. Finally cornices are large and remain a concern: yesterday's fatal accident near Lions Bay illustrates the danger of them breaking off, and the large avalanches they can trigger.</span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">MONDAY: Cloudy with up to 5cm new snow from scattered flurries.
