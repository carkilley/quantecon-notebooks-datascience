In the days during and after the storms, this snow was redistributed by moderate to strong southerly winds from a wide range of directions. This resulted in touchy storm and wind slabs forming and bonding poorly to the previous (January 16) snow surface. This surface includes facets and large surface hoar on sheltered slopes and/or a sun crust on steep sun-exposed aspects, as well as wind-affected surfaces (e.g. hard wind slab, sastrugi, scoured crust, etc.) in exposed areas. Weaknesses within the recent storm snow have been settling, but the bond of the storm snow to the previous cold snow surface from over a week ago is less reliable. Thin snowpack areas such as the South Chilcotin mountains remain the most likely to harbour this and other persistent weaknesses.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\"> </span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\"> </span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_384D933F\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Friday: Mainly cloudy.

Saturday's fatal avalanche accident on Mt. Harvey, although not in the South Coast Inland region, does highlight several of the risks posed by cornices: multi-ton snow boulders serve as large triggers potentially releasing large avalanches on the slopes below, they can break well back making for tricky travel along ridge crests. It's all the more tricky when visibility is obscured in fog or heavy snow, if the easiest pathway (flat, hard snow, open straight line) is within the danger zone, or when they're so big that you need to be 10 or 15 or more metres back from the edge to remain safe.</span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">Anywhere from 15-25cm of new snow is sitting on a widespread melt-freeze crust that exists on all aspects and elevations except for high elevation north facing terrain.
