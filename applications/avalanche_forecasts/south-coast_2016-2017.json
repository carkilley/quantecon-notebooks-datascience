If there is enough snow to ride without hitting rocks or logs, there is enough snow for avalanches. Significant temperature fluctuations are common at this time of year, often bouncing above and below freezing. If you get a rapid spell of warming or rain after a good dump of snow, there's a good chance an avalanche cycle will occur. The consequences of being caught in an avalanche are heightened at this time of year, since trees, stumps, and rocks are still exposed.

The early season snowpack evolves rapidly especially if it is snowing and blowing; be prepared for major changes in conditions from day to day. Here are some things to look for in the snowpack to help identify potential avalanche danger. First, assess the quality of the slab. If the upper layers feel dense and show a tendency to crack or pull apart as a cohesive element, conditions may be primed for a slab avalanche. Watch the bowls below ridges, gullies, and lee slopes where snow tends to accumulate deep enough to slide. Second, new snow from this year often bonds poorly to pockets of last year’s snow that survived the summer. These pockets are often found near the top of bowls, on the shaded side of steep gullies, under cliffs, on glaciers, and in high elevation, leeward terrain.
