Don't get fooled by a lull in the action--the snowpack is in a very dynamic state right now so natural activity will likely ebb and flow but human triggering will remain likely even when naturals taper off.", "snowpackSummary": "On average, I'm guessing nearly 100cm of new snow has been added to the alpine snowpack in the last few days. Figure half that at treeline. Below treeline it's probably a mixed bag of rain, slush, and snow depending where you are in the region and elevation. Here's my take, based purely on experience, what little information I have from a few select locations, and recent weather. Snowpack depths are looking like 100-150cm at treeline and probably over 250cm in the alpine. Distribution is likely still pretty variable due to winds and variability in storm track and intensity. On a small scale you'll likely see bare ground beside areas with well over 250+cm of snow while on a larger scale, one mountain or drainage may have significantly more or less than the next. The upper part of the snowpack consists entirely of new storm snow in sheltered areas and new wind slabs in exposed locations, both of which are likely settling rapidly with warm temperatures. I'm pretty certain the storm and wind loaded snow is unstable both at the new/old interface and within the new snow at various levels. How unstable and how long the instability lasts in lulls between systems and after this whole thing ends will relate primarily to temperatures. Click on the forecaster blog link below for a bit more detail on this. These layers and the associated problems are changing by the minute and hour so you need to stay on your toes. Settlement will be occurring in the midpack as well but crusts and the November 7 surface hoar, which could be down as deep as 200cm in some locations, continue to be a concern. If these layers have not been destroyed by previous avalanche activity, my gut tells me they are on the edge of the knifeblade and are capable of producing very large slides. I expect settlement is going on in the deeper layers as well. Still a mixed bag there though, with weaker facetted snow in shallow areas, stronger more rounded in deeper locations, and in many cases these layers will be moist at and near the ground. This is a general overview--I'm hesitant to get too specific this early in the season when data is sparse and there's so much spatial (and now with the ongoing storm, temporal) variability.

The natural cycle that we suspect happened on Wednesday is probably over, but the likelihood of human triggered avalanches is still high.

Figure half that at treeline. Below treeline it's probably a mixed bag of rain, slush, and snow depending where you are in the region and elevation. Here's my take, based purely on experience, what little information I have from a few select locations, and recent weather. Snowpack depths are looking like 100-150cm at treeline and probably over 250cm in the alpine. Distribution is likely still pretty variable due to winds and variability in storm track and intensity. On a small scale you'll likely see bare ground beside areas with well over 250+cm of snow while on a larger scale, one mountain or drainage may have significantly more or less than the next. The upper part of the snowpack consists entirely of new storm snow in sheltered areas and new wind slabs in exposed locations, both of which are likely settling rapidly with warm temperatures. I'm pretty certain the storm and wind loaded snow is unstable both at the new/old interface and within the new snow at various levels. How unstable and how long the instability lasts in lulls between systems and after this whole thing ends will relate primarily to temperatures. Click on the forecaster blog link below for a bit more detail on this. These layers and the associated problems are changing by the minute and hour so you need to stay on your toes. Settlement will be occurring in the midpack as well but crusts and the November 7 surface hoar, which could be down as deep as 200cm in some locations, continue to be a concern. If these layers have not been destroyed by previous avalanche activity, my gut tells me they are on the edge of the knifeblade and are capable of producing very large slides. I expect settlement is going on in the deeper layers as well. Still a mixed bag there though, with weaker facetted snow in shallow areas, stronger more rounded in deeper locations, and in many cases these layers will be moist at and near the ground. This is a general overview--I'm hesitant to get too specific this early in the season when data is sparse and there's so much spatial (and now with the ongoing storm, temporal) variability.

I know that there is generally 200 cms of snow in the alpine. Some areas are bound to have closer to 250 cms. There was a period in early November when the conditions were optimal for the development of surface hoar. By the middle of the month when the first heavy snowfalls arrived, we were getting reports of widespread avalanche activity releasing on buried surface hoar from the few areas that were accessible. The snow has continued to build up in the mountains and the winds have been from strong to very strong from various directions. I suspect that the depth of snow in the alpine and at treeline is quite variable due to these winds re-distributing the snow that was available for transport. Last Thursday we had a report from the south Selkirks that there had been a widespread natural cycle of very large avalanches that appeared to have released very near to the ground. This type of activity would usually be because of some kind of early season crust that is thick enough and hard enough that it has not broken down in the 5-6 weeks since it has been buried. I suspect a rain crust because the avalanche activity was observed from several aspects, mostly north and east. If it is a rain crust, maybe it is limited to the South Selkirks? The warm storm that moved through the interior over the weekend deposited about 40-60 cms of snow. The new snow has been pretty heavy at all but the highest alpine elevations. The freezing level has risen to about 1800 metres, and the wind has been very strong out of the southwest. I would not be surprised to find out that natural avalanche activity has occurred on Sunday. Maybe the added load will cause some more avalanches to release down at the rain crust? If not, the new load and warm temperatures might help to settle the snowpack and promote bonding. If it gets cold, the deep weakness may continue to be a problem for a while.  I suggest giving the snowpack a few days to reveal its secrets. I will feel less uncertain once we have more operators reporting from the field.", "weatherForecast": " The trailing cold front should have moved through the Interior ranges by late Sunday. On Monday a weak ridge of high pressure should bring drier conditions, maybe even some sunshine. It would be nice to get out and see what the last storm brought to the mountains.

What I know that there is generally 200 cms of snow in the alpine. Some areas are bound to have closer to 250 cms. There was a period in early November when the conditions were optimal for the development of surface hoar.  Numerous profiles from one portion of the region has confirmed that this layer still exists and is buried around 150cms below the surface, it may be difficult to trigger but has a sudden planar characteristic. This is likely a high consequence scenario if a slope fails on this layer. In the middle of the month when the first heavy snowfalls arrived, we were getting reports of widespread avalanche activity releasing on this buried surface hoar from the few areas that were accessible. The snow has continued to build up in the mountains and the winds have been from strong to very strong from various directions. I suspect that the depth of snow in the alpine and at treeline is quite variable due to these winds re-distributing the snow that was available for transport. Last Thursday we had a report from the south Selkirks that there had been a widespread natural cycle of very large avalanches that appeared to have released very near to the ground. This type of activity would usually be because of some kind of early season crust that is thick enough and hard enough that it has not broken down in the 5-6 weeks since it has been buried. I suspect a rain crust because the avalanche activity was observed from several aspects, mostly north and east. If it is a rain crust, maybe it is limited to the South Selkirks? The warm storm that moved through the interior over the weekend deposited about 40-60 cms of snow. The new snow has been pretty heavy at all but the highest alpine elevations. The freezing level has risen to about 1800 metres, and the wind has been very strong out of the southwest. I would not be surprised to find out that natural avalanche activity has occurred on Sunday. Maybe the added load will cause some more avalanches to release down at the rain crust? If not, the new load and warm temperatures might help to settle the snowpack and promote bonding. If it gets cold, the deep weakness may continue to be a continue to be a problem for a while.  I suggest giving the snowpack a few days to reveal its secrets. I will feel less uncertain once we have more operators reporting from the field.", "weatherForecast": "Light to moderate precipitation is expected over the region this evening accompanied by moderate southwesterly winds.

The strong to extreme southerly winds that persisted on Sunday have formed wind slabs on lee slopes, and terrain features. Winds are now blowing out of the north creating new wind slabs on reverse slopes. The snow depth is currently 200 - 250cm in the alpine. An early November surface hoar layer is buried around 150cm down. Triggering this layer is difficult, but test results continue to show sudden planer shears meaning that this layer has energy and wants to propagate. This is the classic low probability/high consequence avalanche problem.  Mid-November storms produced a widespread avalanche cycle on this layer.On Thursday Nov. 24th we received reports from the Southern Selkirks of a widespread avalanche cycle.  Large avalanches released near the ground on several aspects.  The majority of these observations were from north-east facing slopes.  This was likely the result of an early season rain crust that until last week was bridging over weak basal facets at the ground.  Last weekend's storms pushed it to the breaking point resulting in an avalanche cycle.  Very little is known about this rain crust, especially when it comes to distribution.  Is it limited to the Southern Selkirks, or is it more widespread?Last weekend's warm storm deposited 40-60cm's of snow which has been pretty heavy at all but the highest alpine elevations as freezing levels rose to 1800m. Rain also fell 1500m and below leaving us with a rain crust. Mid week up to 30cm fell on top of this rain crust. this crust.

The big lurking danger remains the early February Surface Hoar that is now around 100 - 200cm deep.  The snow above this weak layer has been under the influence of warmth and time which has settled the snow into a thick cohesive slab.  Obviously, when a slab almost as tall as the average Canadian releases, the consequences are severe.

The snowpack is far from isothermic, but the mercury has climbed above 0 as high as 2500m over the last 7 days.  These warm temps have really helped to settle out the upper snowpack.  Professionals throughout the region are reporting a very well settled & firm upper snowpack with minimum concerns in the upper 150cm.  The spring sun is increasing in strength as each day grows by a few minutes.  It takes very little time for S, SE & SW aspects to feel the heat of the sun now.  W & E facing slopes are just starting to be affected by the sun as we head into the tail end of March.The effect of the sun becomes very important at this time of the year.  We're expecting 5 - 10 cm of snow above 1500 m the next few days.  As soon as the sun comes out, watch for roller-balling & pin-wheeling to start surprisingly quickly.  Wet point release avalanches won't be far behind on slopes receiving direct sun.There's a lot of strong snow between recreationists and the February surface hoar layers and it's been a few days since there was a large deep avalanche in the region.  That being said, it could still be triggered.  I'm thinking of three different scenarios at the moment:  1.  The most likely scenario is a large cornice or icefall failure impacting the slope below and producing a very large avalanche.  Managing this piece of the hazard puzzle is done by monitoring what's happening above you.  Cornices or slopes receiving direct sun are suspect.  If you feel like there's a question as to whether or not a piece of cornice is warming to its breaking point, then, there's no question, it's time to get off that slope.  2.  Just last weekend an experienced party remote triggered a very large avalanche in Glacier Park near Mt. Tupper.  This makes me think that it may still be possible for skiers or sledders to trigger very large avalanches failing 1.5 - 2m in depth.  The most likely location for this type of failure is where the snowpack goes from thick to thin.  This is most likely near ridge crests, the edges of slopes and especially around rock outcroppings.  3.  While I don't foresee it occurring in the next few days, a slope that does not experience an overnight refreeze is suspect for producing large avalanches.  This is something to think about as we flip our calendars to the April page.", "weatherForecast": " The Gulf of Alaska drives a relatively moist weather pattern for the second half of the week.

These slopes are likely rain soaked at this point too, making for a sloppy wet snowpack at lower elevations.The spring sun is increasing in strength as each day grows by a few minutes.  It takes very little time for S, SE & SW aspects to feel the heat of the sun now.  W & E facing slopes are just starting to be affected by the sun as we head into the tail end of March.The effect of the sun becomes very important at this time of the year.  We're expecting 5 - 10 cm of snow above 1500 m the next few days.  As soon as the sun comes out, watch for roller-balling & pin-wheeling to start surprisingly quickly.  Wet point release avalanches won't be far behind on slopes receiving direct sun.There's a lot of strong snow between recreationists and the February surface hoar layers and it's been a few days since there was a large deep avalanche in the region.  That being said, it could still be triggered.  I'm thinking of three different scenarios at the moment:1.  The most likely scenario is a large cornice or icefall failure impacting the slope below and producing a very large avalanche.  Managing this piece of the hazard puzzle is done by monitoring what's happening above you.  Cornices or slopes receiving direct sun are suspect.  If you feel like there's a question as to whether or not a piece of cornice is warming to its breaking point, then, there's no question, it's time to get off that slope.2.  Just last weekend an experienced party remote triggered a very large avalanche in Glacier Park near Mt. Tupper.  This makes me think that it may still be possible for skiers or sledders to trigger very large avalanches failing 1.5 - 2m in depth.  The most likely location for this type of failure is where the snowpack goes from thick to thin.  This is most likely near ridge crests, the edges of slopes and especially around rock outcroppings.3.  While I don't foresee it occurring in the next few days, a slope that does not experience an overnight refreeze is suspect for producing large avalanches.
