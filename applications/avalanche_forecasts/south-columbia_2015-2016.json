Northerly winds associated with last weeks outbreak of Arctic air stripped many south facing features near ridgecrest. As a result, tired old wind slabs have been reported on north facing features at and above treeline. The cold air and associated inversion created trophy surface hoar that seems to average around 20mm in size and can be found from creek bottom up to around 1800m. Sun and above freezing alpine temperatures were also part of the last week, so you're likely to find a suncrust on solar aspects (south and west) at and above treeline. The three different November surface hoar interfaces that we were previously concerned about seem to be a thing of the past and are not producing any activity.

As a result, wind slabs that have now grown old and tired were reported on north facing features at and above treeline. The cold air and associated inversion created surface facets and the well reported trophy sized surface hoar that averages 20mm in size and can be found from creek bottom up to around 1800m. Sun and above freezing alpine temperatures were also part of the last week of wonky November weather, so you'll find a suncrust at and above treeline just under the new storm snow on solar aspects. The three different November surface hoar interfaces that we were previously concerned about seem to be a thing of the past. It's thought that there is also a crust/facet interface on or just above the ground on high elevation north facing features, but this interface is likely very isolated and is probably inactive at this time.</span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<style type=\"text/css\">\n.p_CC664AAA { margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;text-align: left;text-indent: 0pt;padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; } \n.s_3FE45715 { font-family: 'Arial';font-style: Normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 13.3333333333333px;color: #000000; } \n</style><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">A series of rather warm systems are stacked up off the Coast of BC.

Its expected that some of this energy will spill over into the Mountains of the South Columbia, but its impossible to say just how much. Thursday should deliver a few centimeters of snow during the day and winds are expected to be strong out of the SW as the freezing level climbs towards 1700m. Thursday night should usher in a few more centimeters as the freezing level hovers around 1700m. Another few centimeters are expected Friday with the freezing level around 1500m. Saturday and Saturday night may offer more juicy systems, but its too far out to say what the impact will be, the pattern is just too dynamic to even provide a reliable guess.

In some areas these new wind slabs may be sitting on a layer of surface hoar. In other areas wind probably destroyed the surface hoar, or freezing drizzle created a thin crust at the beginning of the storm. I have continued to call the avalanche problem a wind slab, due to the widespread nature of the strong southwest winds. A thin new storm slab may exist in some areas in the south of the region. The persistent weak layer that was buried in early January is now down about 50-100 cm. This thick persistent slab overlies a variety of surfaces including large surface hoar, sun crusts, rime crusts and facets. The slab is ripe for human and natural triggers and is especially touchy at and below treeline.

Old wind slabs still linger on lee features at treeline and in the alpine and may become more reactive with solar radiation. 60-110cm below the surface you'll find a persistent weak layer comprised of surface hoar, facets and/or a thick crust. This layer seems variably reactive. In other words, it's still reactive to human triggers in some places while in other spots it's really tough to trigger, and there's not much of a reliable pattern telling us what exact aspects are most suspect. I'd continue to be suspicious of steep, unsupported features at treeline and in the alpine as this layer has the potential to produce large avalanches.

Some areas have reported a new layer of surface hoar growing in high sheltered alpine locations above 2300 metres. Approximately 40-50 cm of settled storm snow sits on a melt-freeze crust buried on Mar. 22. The late February persistent weak layer is an aspect dependant mix of surface hoar, facets and/or a thick crust down around 60-110 cm below the snow surface. Commercial operators continue to see hard sudden planar results in snowpack tests, which suggests that wide fracture propagations are possible. Cornices continue to be described as large and fragile. Expect loose wet avalanches and natural cornice falls with strong solar radiation and significant warming this week.

If the snow surface does not freeze overnight or if the crust is only a few cm thick, the effect of daytime heating and solar radiation will weaken the snowpack much more quickly than it would if there is a well frozen thick crust. This is because the crust must first melt before the sun can weaken the snowpack. Deeply buried weak layers in the mid snowpack and near the ground still have the potential to wake up and become active with a rapid warm up. While unlikely, releases on these deeply buried weak layers would result in very large avalanches. Glide cracks are widespread, active, and best avoided. Cornices are large, fragile, and could trigger deep slab avalanches that run to valley bottoms. Low elevation and thin snowpack areas have become isothermal, meaning the snowpack is 0 degrees Celsius throughout. An isothermal snowpack is more prone to full depth wet slab avalanches during the heat of the day.</span><span class=\"s_3FE45715\" /></p>", "weatherForecast": "<style type=\"text/css\">\n.p_CC664AAA { margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;text-align: left;text-indent: 0pt;padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; } \n.s_3FE45715 { font-family: 'Arial';font-style: Normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 13.3333333333333px;color: #000000; } \n.s_AA239A9B { font-family: 'Arial';font-style: Normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 13px;color: #000000; } \n</style><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">SUNDAY: Freezing Level: 3200m, sunny, light southerly winds.

If the snow surface does not freeze overnight or if the crust is only a few cm thick, the effect of daytime heating, rain or solar radiation will weaken the snowpack much more quickly than it would if there is a well frozen thick crust.
