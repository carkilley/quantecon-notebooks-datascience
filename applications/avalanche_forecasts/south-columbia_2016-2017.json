Pockets of wind slab in steep lee terrain will likely remain reactive over the short term. Friday's reports included several size 1-1.5 wind slab avalanches releasing from steeper terrain on mostly north to northeast aspects. A report of particular interest details a Size 2 avalanche releasing from a lower-angle south aspect in the Valhalla Range. Although isolated, it being reported to have failed on the 25 cm-deep December 26 surface hoar layer raises concern for shallower snowpack areas. Aside from wind slab and possible persistent slab problems, additional caution is advised in steep terrain where loose snow sluffing may present an unexpected hazard.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\"> </span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Recent cold and clear weather has promoted both faceting of surface snow as well as the growth of surface hoar that has been reported to be up to 10mm in size in some areas. Reports also exist of a sun crust beginning to form on steep solar aspects. Below the surface, up to 30 cm of low density snow fell earlier this week. During and in the days after the storm, moderate to strong southwest and then northerly winds shifted this snow into reactive wind slabs on leeward slopes. The mid-December facet/surface hoar persistent weakness can be found buried 70-120 cm deep and is generally considered dormant. However, we are still receiving occasional reports of sudden results in snowpack tests, suggesting that it has to potential to propagate into a large avalanche if triggered, particularly in shallow spots where this layer is closer to the snow surface.

The wind is forecast to change to the west, and this may result in reverse loading. This new now is sitting on the 30-50 cm of recent snow from the past week. The new and recent snow are covering a mix of old surfaces, including several crusts on all aspects at treeline and below, and on solar aspects in the alpine. Cornices continue to be reported to be large and fragile, and the have released naturally on a regular basis. The February weak layers are now down about 170-220 cm and the deep mid-December facet layer and November rain crust both still linger near the bottom of the snowpack. These deep weak layers produced large avalanches with cornice falls and other heavy triggers in late March and early April. Yet another deep release was reported in the region on Saturday. This activity, although growing more sporadic, is keeping these layers an ongoing concern. They may be more likely to fail on southerly aspects during periods of strong solar radiation.</span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Overnight: 5-15 cm of new snow with moderate southwest winds and freezing down to 800 metres.
