Regardless, slopes at higher elevations have produced avalanches large enough to run down to terrain located well below treeline.  In the alpine, and at treeline the snowpack depth generally sits anywhere from 80-120cm with deposits of up to 400 cm on wind-loaded features.Reports suggest that strong to extreme winds in a few parts of the region have stripped west aspects of snow creating wind slabs on lee and cross-loaded aspects in the alpine and at treeline. Many of these new windslabs could be sitting on the reactive October rain crust located a few cms above the ground. This rain crust may have weak, overlying facets and is widespread in the alpine and isolated in its distribution at treeline. This is a classic low probability-high consequence scenario where the snow may have been gaining strength, but the consequence of a full-depth avalanche could be disastrous. It's worth noting that while the crust-facet combo has been an issue in some areas, it seems to be non-existent in others parts of the region. The 'take home' message is that the region as a whole is data-sparse and extremely variable in terms of snowpack structure.
