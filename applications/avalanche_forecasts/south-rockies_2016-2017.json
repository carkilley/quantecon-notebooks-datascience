These early season slabs occur most readily where early season riding is good, that is where the underlying ground is smooth in places like grassy slopes, rock slabs, or glaciers. If there is enough snow to ride without hitting rocks or logs, there is enough snow for avalanches. Significant temperature fluctuations are common at this time of year, often bouncing above and below freezing. If you get a rapid spell of warming or rain after a good dump of snow, there's a good chance an avalanche cycle will occur. The consequences of being caught in an avalanche are heightened at this time of year, since trees, stumps, and rocks are still exposed. Terrain traps are more pronounced and it is advisable to minimize exposure to gullies, open water, cliffs, and rapid transitions from steep to flat where the consequences of even a small avalanche can be severe. Ice climbs with terrain above require careful planning and should be treated as avalanche terrain when there is potential for even small slides from above.</span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">Expect big changes to the snowpack structure with altitude; you might find full-on winter conditions in the alpine, rugged travel at treeline, and no coverage at lower elevations. The early season snowpack evolves rapidly especially if it is snowing and blowing; be prepared for major changes in conditions from day to day. Here are some things to look for in the snowpack to help identify potential avalanche danger. First, assess the quality of the slab. If the upper layers feel dense and show a tendency to crack or pull apart as a cohesive element, conditions may be primed for a slab avalanche. Watch the bowls below ridges, gullies, and lee slopes where snow tends to accumulate deep enough to slide. Second, new snow from this year often bonds poorly to pockets of last year’s snow that survived the summer. These pockets are often found near the top of bowls, on the shaded side of steep gullies, under cliffs, on glaciers, and in high elevation, leeward terrain. Third, crusts are common in early season new snow often bonds poorly to these crusts. If you see or feel crusts, check the bond of overlying snow, especially if loose, sugary facetted grains lie above or below the crust.</span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">For daily mountain weather forecasts visit: http://www.avalanche.ca/weather</span></p>", "dangerMode": "Early season"}, {"id": "PC-13_2016-11-21T2300_5880fc47-04d9-43ed-a41a-6ffd5457f267", "region": "south-rockies", "forecaster": "rbuhler", "dateIssued": "2016-11-21T23:37:05Z", "validUntil": "2016-11-22T22:00:00Z", "bulletinTitle": "Avalanche Bulletin - South Rockies", "highlights": "<p class=\"p_91E506DB\"><span class=\"s_E5CBE62C\">It's early in the season but there is likely enough snow for avalanches at treeline and above.

On Saturday, wind slabs are expected to be the primary concern resulting from new snow and strong to extreme southwest winds from earlier this week. There is a bit of uncertainty regarding how last week's snow will bond to old surfaces that formed during the cold snap. Due to these potentially persistent weak layers, wind slabs may remain sensitive to human triggering for some time. In the southeast corner of the region, there are concerns about a deep persistent problem. A weakness at the bottom of the snowpack has produced some large avalanches recently. Human triggering may be possible in thin areas or smaller avalanches have the potential to step down to this layer resulting in full depth avalanches.</span></p>", "snowpackSummary": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">10-20 cm of new low density snow sits above 15-40 cm of settled storm snow. The storm snow has been redistributed into wind slabs in exposed terrain by strong to extreme winds. The new snow buries a variable surface that developed during the cold, dry, and windy conditions from earlier this month. This interface consists of scoured surfaces and wind slabs in wind exposed terrain, weak faceted (sugary) snow, and feathery surface hoar up to 20 mm in sheltered areas. In sheltered areas, there may be another layer of surface hoar in the upper snowpack which was buried around December 10. Observations have been limited, however, the reports we've received suggest the mid and lower snowpack are somewhat unconsolidated and faceting exists to varying degrees. Below treeline, the snowpack is very shallow and early season hazards such as stumps, rocks, and open creeks are still a major concern.</span></p>", "weatherForecast": "<p class=\"p_384D933F\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">SATURDAY: Flurries with accumulations of 5-10 cm, light southeast winds, alpine temperatures around -12C.</span></p><p class=\"p_384D933F\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">SUNDAY: Dry and clearing, light northwest winds, alpine temperatures around -15C.</span></p><p class=\"p_384D933F\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">MONDAY: Dry and clear, west winds increasing throughout the day reaching 50 km/h, alpine temperatures around -12C.</span></p>", "dangerMode": "Regular season"}, {"id": "PC-13_2016-12-25T2300_bbd6d25d-ef5e-464c-9248-1b23effac37e", "region": "south-rockies", "forecaster": "shorton", "dateIssued": "2016-12-25T23:32:22+00:00", "validUntil": "2016-12-26T22:00:00Z", "bulletinTitle": "Avalanche Bulletin - South Rockies", "highlights": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Strong winds will increase the avalanche danger in the upcoming days.</span></p>", "confidence": "Moderate - Timing, track, or intensity of incoming weather system is uncertain", "dangerRatings": [{"date": "2016-12-26T00:00:00Z", "dangerRating": {"alp": "3:Considerable", "tln": "2:Moderate", "btl": "1:Low"}}, {"date": "2016-12-27T00:00:00Z", "dangerRating": {"alp": "3:Considerable", "tln": "3:Considerable", "btl": "2:Moderate"}}, {"date": "2016-12-28T00:00:00Z", "dangerRating": {"alp": "3:Considerable", "tln": "2:Moderate", "btl": "1:Low"}}], "problems": [{"type": "Persistent Slabs", "elevations": ["Tln", "Alp", "Btl"], "aspects": ["NW", "NE", "SE", "S", "SW", "W", "N", "E"], "likelihood": "Likely - Possible", "expectedSize": {"min": "1.5", "max": "2.5"}, "comment": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">Weak faceted snow exists in the lower snowpack and may be possible to trigger in thin snowpack areas or on wind-loaded slopes.</span></p>", "travelAndTerrainAdvice": "<ul class='ttalist'><li>Carefully evaluate and use caution around thin snowpack areas.</li><li>Be aware of the potential for full depth avalanches due to deeply buried weak layers.</li><li>Watch for signs of instability such as whumpfing, or cracking. </li></ul>", "icons": {"elevations": "https://www.avalanche.ca/assets/images/Elevation/Elevation-1-1-1_EN.png", "aspects": "https://www.avalanche.ca/assets/images/Compass/compass-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1_EN.png", "likelihood": "https://www.avalanche.ca/assets/images/Likelihood/Likelihood-4_EN.png", "expectedSize": "https://www.avalanche.ca/assets/images/size/Size-15-25_EN.png"}}, {"type": "Wind Slabs", "elevations": ["Alp", "Tln"], "aspects": ["N", "NE", "E", "SE", "S"], "likelihood": "Likely", "expectedSize": {"min": "1.0", "max": "1.5"}, "comment": "<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">Expect increasing winds to redistribute the loose surface snow and form touchy wind slabs.
